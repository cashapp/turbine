# Turbine

Turbine is a small testing library for kotlinx.coroutines
[`Flow`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/).

```kotlin
flowOf("one", "two").test {
  assertEquals("one", expectItem())
  assertEquals("two", expectItem())
  expectComplete()
}
```

> A turbine is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work.

## Usage

The entrypoint for the library is the `test` extension for `Flow<T>` which accepts a validation
block. Like `collect`, `test` is a suspending function that will not return until the flow is
complete or canceled.

```kotlin
someFlow.test {
  // Validation code here!
}
```

#### Consuming Events

Inside the `test` block you must consume all received events from the flow. Failing to consume all
events will fail your test.

```kotlin
flowOf("one", "two").test {
  assertEquals("one", expectItem())
}
```
```
Exception in thread "main" AssertionError:
  Unconsumed events found:
   - Item(two)
   - Complete
```

As the exception indicates, consuming the `"two"` item is not enough. The complete event must
also be consumed.

```kotlin
flowOf("one", "two").test {
  assertEquals("one", expectItem())
  assertEquals("two", expectItem())
  expectComplete()
}
```

Received events can be explicitly ignored, however.

```kotlin
flowOf("one", "two").test {
  assertEquals("one", expectItem())
  cancelAndIgnoreRemainingEvents()
}
```

#### Consuming Errors

Unlike `collect`, a flow which causes an exception will still be exposed as an event that you
must consume.

```kotlin
flow { throw RuntimeException("broken!") }.test {
  assertEquals("broken!", expectError().message)
}
```

Failure to consume an error will result in the same unconsumed event exception as above, but
with the exception added as the cause so that the full stacktrace is available.

```kotlin
flow { throw RuntimeException("broken!") }.test { }
```
```
java.lang.AssertionError: Unconsumed events found:
 - Error(RuntimeException)
    at app.cash.turbine.ChannelBasedFlowTurbine.ensureAllEventsConsumed(FlowTurbine.kt:240)
    ... 53 more
Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: broken!
    at example.MainKt$main$1.invokeSuspend(Main.kt:7)
    ... 32 more
```

#### Asynchronous Flows

Calls to `expectItem()`, `expectComplete()`, and `expectError()` are suspending and will wait
for events from asynchronous flows.

```kotlin
channelFlow {
  withContext(IO) {
    Thread.sleep(100)
    send("item")
  }
}.test {
  assertEquals("item", expectItem())
  expectComplete()
}
```

By default, when one of the "expect" methods suspends waiting for an event it will timeout after
one second.

```kotlin
channelFlow {
  withContext(IO) {
    Thread.sleep(2_000)
    send("item")
  }
}.test {
  assertEquals("item", expectItem())
  expectComplete()
}
```
```
Exception in thread "main" TimeoutCancellationException: Timed out waiting for 1000 ms
```

A longer timeout can be specified as an argument to `test`.

```kotlin
channelFlow {
  withContext(IO) {
    Thread.sleep(2_000)
    send("item")
  }
}.test(timeout = 3.seconds) {
  assertEquals("item", expectItem())
  expectComplete()
}
```

Asynchronous flows can be canceled at any time and will not require consuming a complete or
error event.

```kotlin
channelFlow {
  withContext(IO) {
    repeat(10) {
      Thread.sleep(200)
      send("item $it")
    }
  }
}.test {
  assertEquals("item 0", expectItem())
  assertEquals("item 1", expectItem())
  assertEquals("item 2", expectItem())
  cancel()
}
```

## Experimental API Usage

Turbine uses Kotlin experimental APIs:

 * `Duration` is used to declare the event timeout.
 * `launch(start=UNDISPATCHED)` is used to ensure we start collecting events from the `Flow` before
   invoking the test lambda.

Since the library targets test code, the impact and risk of any breaking changes to these APIs are
minimal and would likely only require a version bump.

Instead of sprinkling the experimental annotations or `@OptIn` all over your tests, opt-in at the
compiler level.

```groovy
compileTestKotlin {
  kotlinOptions {
    freeCompilerArgs += [
        '-Xopt-in=kotlin.time.ExperimentalTime',
        '-Xopt-in=kotlinx.coroutines.ExperimentalCoroutinesApi',
    ]
  }
}
```

For multiplatform projects:

```groovy
kotlin {
  sourceSets.matching { it.name.endsWith("Test") }.all {
    it.languageSettings {
      useExperimentalAnnotation('kotlin.time.ExperimentalTime')
      useExperimentalAnnotation('kotlinx.coroutines.ExperimentalCoroutinesApi')
    }
  }
}
```
