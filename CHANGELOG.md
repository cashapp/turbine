# Change Log

## [Unreleased]


## [0.9.0]
- `FlowTurbine` is now called `ReceiveTurbine`. This is the consume-only type with which you assert on events it has seen (historically only from a `Flow`).
- New public `Turbine` type implements `ReceiveTurbine` but also allows you write events from a data source. Use this to implement fakes or collect events from non-`Flow` streams.
- Extension functions on `ReceiveChannel` provide `ReceiveTurbine`-like assertion capabilities.
- Support for legacy JS has been removed. Only JS IR is now supported.
- Removed some APIs deprecated in 0.8.x.


## [0.8.0]
### Added
- New `testIn` API allows testing multiple flows without nesting lambdas.
- New `skip(Int)` API can replace one or more calls to `awaitItem()` where the result is not needed.

### Changed
- Removed timeout parameter. The new `runTest` API from kotlinx.coroutines enforces a timeout automatically.
- Documented that flows are implicitly canceled at the end of the `test` lambda. This has been the behavior for a few versions by accident, but now it is explicit and documented.
- Cancel (and friends) are now suspending functions to ensure that non-canceleable coroutines complete and their effects are observed deterministically.


## [0.7.0]
### Changed
- Moved APIs using Kotlin's experimental time to separate extensions. You can now use the library
  without worrying about incompatibilities with Kotlin version or coroutine library version.
- Removed APIs deprecated in 0.6.x.

## [0.6.1]
### Added
- Support Apple silicon targets for native users.

## [0.6.0]
### Added
- `expectMostRecentItem()` function consumes all received items and returns the most recent item.

### Changed
- Functions which may suspend to wait for an event are now prefixed with 'await'.

## [0.5.2]
### Fixed
- Support running on a background thread with Kotlin/Native.

## [0.5.1]
### Added
- Support watchOS 64-bit.

## [0.5.0]
### Changed
- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.5.0.
- Upgrade to kotlinx.coroutines 1.5.0.

## [0.5.0-rc1]
### Changed
- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.5.0.
- Upgrade to kotlinx.coroutines 1.5.0-RC.

## [0.4.1]
### Changed
- Upgrade to kotlinx.coroutines 1.4.3.
- Removed requirement to opt-in to `@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi`.

## [0.4.0]
### Changed
- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.4.30.

## [0.3.0]
### Added
- `cancelAndConsumeRemainingEvents()` cancels the `Flow` and returns any unconsumed events which were already received.
- `expectEvent()` waits for an event (item, complete, or error) and returns it as a sealed type `Event`.

## [0.2.1]
### Added
- Support Javascript IR backend.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-08-17
### Changed
- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.4.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-08-03
### Fixed
- Use the [`Unconfined`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-dispatchers/-unconfined.html) dispatcher for the internal flow collection coroutine which should eliminate the need to use `yield()` in tests.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-08-03
