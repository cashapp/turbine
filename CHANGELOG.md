# Change Log

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `cancelAndConsumeRemainingEvents()` cancels the `Flow` and returns any unconsumed events which were already received.
- `expectEvent()` waits for an event (item, complete, or error) and returns it as a sealed type `Event`.

## [0.2.1]
### Added
- Support Javascript IR backend.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-08-17
### Changed
- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.4.

## [0.1.1] - 2020-08-03
### Fixed
- Use the [`Unconfined`](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-dispatchers/-unconfined.html) dispatcher for the internal flow collection coroutine which should eliminate the need to use `yield()` in tests.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-08-03
